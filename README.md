# ToDoList
Basic Flask web application to maintain a to do list

This project is developed as a start to my Flask learning journey.

This ToDo app uses sqllite dtabase for CRUD operations.

It gives options to add, update, delete & view tasks.

A virtual environment flaskintro has been added as well.

Activate virtual environment using:
./flaskintro/Scripts/activate

Run app with:
python app.py
